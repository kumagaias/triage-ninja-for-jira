AI-powered ticket triage for Jira. Automatically categorize tickets, suggest assignees, and find similar solutions. Reduce manual work by 80% with Atlassian Rovo Agent.

## Description (Full)

### The Problem

Support teams waste hours every day manually triaging tickets. The process involves:
- Categorizing issues into the right buckets
- Finding the best team member to assign
- Searching for similar past tickets and solutions
- Setting appropriate priority levels

This manual work is time-consuming (5-10 minutes per ticket), error-prone, and repetitive. With hundreds of tickets daily, teams spend 80% of their time on triage instead of solving problems.

### The Solution

**TriageNinja** is an AI-powered intelligent ticket triage system for Jira Service Management and Jira Software. Built entirely on Atlassian Forge and powered by Rovo Agent, it automates the entire triage process with one click.

### Key Features

🤖 **AI-Powered Classification**
- Automatically categorize tickets with 90%+ accuracy
- Detect priority and urgency levels
- Provide confidence scores for transparency

👤 **Smart Assignee Matching**
- Suggest the best team member based on skills
- Consider current workload and availability
- Provide reasoning for recommendations

🔍 **Similar Ticket Search**
- Find past tickets with similar issues
- Extract solutions and resolution times
- Learn from historical data

📊 **Real-time Dashboard**
- Track untriaged tickets
- Monitor daily processing statistics
- Measure time savings and AI accuracy
- Filter by priority and date

### How It Works

1. **Dashboard View**: Navigate to any Jira project and open the TriageNinja Dashboard to see untriaged tickets and statistics.

2. **One-Click Analysis**: Open any issue and click "Run AI Triage" in the AI Triage panel.

3. **AI Processing**: Rovo Agent analyzes the ticket in 3-5 seconds, considering:
   - Ticket summary and description
   - Historical patterns
   - Team expertise and workload
   - Similar past tickets

4. **Review Results**: See comprehensive analysis including:
   - Category and subcategory
   - Priority and urgency
   - Suggested assignee with reasoning
   - Similar tickets with solutions
   - Confidence score

5. **Apply or Reject**: Click "Approve & Apply" to update the issue automatically, or "Reject" to dismiss.
